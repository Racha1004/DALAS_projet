# DALAS_projet
# Project

The objective of this project is to practice all concepts taught in the main lecture. Therefore, you will have to collect data around a thematic, identify a problematic, clean and format the data, provide some exploratory analysis and visualization, build models and evaluate them. You will have also to design dashboard and to storytell the whole pipeline.


The whole project will have two outputs describing the methodology and the results:
* A technical report targeting your datascientist colleagues
* An oral presentation targeting your CEO, chief, client. In this case, we assume that the audience is not specialized in data science. (But you also need to present the methodology to convince them to trust the results).


**Requests:**
* Team work of two people (same group throughout the semester)
* All your work should be stored on a git repo: [tutorial](https://github.com/baskiotisn/2IN013robot2023/blob/d979333fb80c9b6acd9515aaec040943d10d365c/docs/tutoriel_git.pdf)

**Remarks:**
There are also other libraries or issues you'll encounter when collecting data. Some of these are listed below, but don't be shy and interact with a search engine to solve your own issue!
* [Regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html) might be useful!
* [API with authentication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/authentication-using-python-requests/)
*   [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) when pages are generated wia javascript scripts
* [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) --> looks easier and more adapted than Selenium
* [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) for web crawling / or when you don't know the URL.[Tuto here](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html)
